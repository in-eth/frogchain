# `x/amm`

## Abstract

This document specifies the amm module of the Frogchain Network.

The Automated Market Making (AMM) module is responsible for handling token swaps. It is designed to provide decentralized exchange functionality similar to Uniswap on the Ethereum network. It enables efficient and frictionless trading of digital assets within the Cosmos ecosystem.

This module is used in the Frogchain Network.

## Concepts

Already mentioned before, it implements the concepts of uniswap v2.

If you want more about that:
```uniswap reference
https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works
```


**Note:** The amm module is made to implement uniswap v2 platform in cosmos network, while it has some differences.

The differences are:

* `uniswap` - a pool only includes 2 coin types to swap from one coin to another coin(exactly path includes only 2 tokens). If you want to include more tokens in path, it causes more transactions generation.
* `amm` - a pool can include many coins unlike uniswap so that you can swap tokens with complex routes in one transaction.

## Pool State

Pools contain pool information for a uniquely identified pool and for swap including pool id, pool params, pool assets, and share tokens. For efficiency, since pool tokens must also be feetchd to swap, pool structs also store the balance of pool assets as `sdk.Coin`.

The `Pool` interface is defined as follows:

```go
type Pool struct {
	Id uint64
	PoolParam PoolParam // pool params for swap and exit fees
	PoolAssets   []types.Coin // assets in the pool
	AssetWeights []uint64 // represents the weight of pool asset
	ShareToken types.Coi// LP token
	MinimumLiquidity uint64 // min liquidity is the minimum amount of share token to maintain the pool
	IsActivated bool // Pool activate state
}
```

### Pool Param

PoolParam contains information for pool fees. That includes the fees and fee collector's address.
Fees are divided into two parts.

 1. Swap Fee
 : fee percent for swap tokens. Module cut fee from incoming tokens and send it to fee collector.
 1. Exit Fee
 : fee percent for remove liquidity. Amm cut fee from burning share token and send it to fee collector. It's for pool maintaince so that the pool can work regularly without that liquidity provider.

 Fee range is 0~10^8 meaning that 10^8 represents 100%.

 FeeCollector is and address represents the user collects the fees.

 The `PoolParam` interface is defined as follows:

```go
type PoolParam struct {
	// 100% of the swap fee goes to the liquidity providers â€” the amount of the
	// underlying token that can beredeemed by each pool token increases.
	// this represents the percent * 10^6 for the float. (0 ~ 10^8)
	SwapFee uint64 

	// When exiting a pool, the user provides the minimum amount of tokens they are
	// willing to receive as they are returning their shares of the pool. However,
	// unlike joining a pool, exiting a pool requires the user to pay the exit fee,
	// which is set as a param of the pool. The user's share tokens burnt as result.
	// Exiting the pool using a single asset is also possible.
	// this represents the percent * 10^6 for the float. (0 ~ 10^8)
	ExitFee uint64 
	
	FeeCollector string // feeCollector is an address which receive fees(for swap and exit)
}
```

### Pool Asset & Weight

Pool Asset is a `type.Coin` type that has coin `Denom` which represents the coin name and `Amount` indicates the amount of coin.

Weight is for swap tokens. It controls the coin's value so that you can change the weight when coin has not enough worth.

### Pool Share Token

Pool Share Token is a `type.Coin` type like pool asset but has a meaningful value.

When liquidity provider deposits coins for a pool, then he receives the liquidity - share token.
Share Token represents the sovereignty of the pool, meaning how many coins are owned by the provider. So if the provider withdraw the liquidity, the owned coins are withdrawed from the pool(except the fee amount).

### Minimum Liquidity

Minimum Liquidity is a value for maintaining the pool. It's cut from the liquidity of the creator so that the pool makes creator can not modify the rate of coins.

It's defined as 1000 here, but can modify if you want.

## Messages
